               unsuitable habitat. This perspective is still apparent in many
               studies of marine metapopulations, in which recruitment
               variation is generally assumed to be primarily the result of
               variability in ocean currents and interactions with disperser
               behavior, with little consideration of spatial structure that
               can affect disperser viability. We use a simple model of
               dispersal of marine larvae to demonstrate how heterogeneity in
               dispersal habitat (i.e., the matrix) can generate substantial
               spatial variation in recruitment. Furthermore, we show how this
               heterogeneity can interact with larval life-history variation to
               create alternative patterns of source-sink dynamics. Finally, we
               place our results in the context of spatially structured matrix
               population models, and we propose the damping ratio of the

              analytical approximation formula by Frank and Wissel [K. Frank,
              C. Wissel, A formula for the mean lifetime of metapopulations in
              heterogeneous landscapes, Am. Nat. 159 (2002) 530] and extends it
              by abstracting from individual patch locations. The mean
              metapopulation lifetime is expressed as a function of four
              macroscopic network properties: the ratio of dispersal range and
              network size, the ratio of range of environmental correlation and
              network size, and the total number and (geometric mean) size of
              the patches. The analysis takes into account that (ceteris

              contribute less to metapopulation survival than patches close to
              the centre of the network. Ignoring this fact can lead to a
              substantial overestimation of the mean metapopulation lifetime.
              Due to its numerical simplicity, the formula can be used as a
              conservation objective function even in complex network design

               individuals between populations across the landscape. The
               environment that the migrants must traverse is influenced by
               many forces, so the connections are often complicated pathways,
               which can be represented as a network. The structure of these
               networks will determine which populations will receive more
               migrants than other populations, and this in turn affects the
               lifetime of the metapopulation. We present a modification of the
               Drechsler (2009) formulae for the mean lifetime of a
               metapopulation based on network properties where the arrangement
               of the population connections is not limited to simple dispersal

               demographics. We demonstrate that when dispersal is explicitly
               included in the model, the growth rates for all patches
               calculated in an analogous manner (the ``observed'' lambda,

               these situations we suggest an alternative method of estimating
               patch contribution (the ``contribution'' lambda, $\lambda$C) in

  author   = "Hanski, I and Ovaskainen, O",
  abstract = "Ecologists and conservation biologists have used many measures of
              landscape structure to predict the population dynamic
              consequences of habitat loss and fragmentation, but these
              measures are not well justified by population dynamic theory.
              Here we introduce a new measure for highly fragmented landscapes,
              termed the metapopulation capacity, which is rigorously derived
              from metapopulation theory and can easily be applied to real
              networks of habitat fragments with known areas and
              connectivities. Technically, metapopulation capacity is the
              leading eigenvalue of an appropriate 'landscape' matrix. A
              species is predicted to persist in a landscape if the
              metapopulation capacity of that landscape is greater than a
              threshold value determined by the properties of the species.
              Therefore, metapopulation capacity can conveniently be used to
              rank different landscapes in terms of their capacity to support
              viable metapopulations. We present an empirical example on
              multiple networks occupied by an endangered species of butterfly.
              Using this theory, we may also calculate how the metapopulation
              capacity is changed by removing habitat fragments from or adding
              new ones into specific spatial locations, or by changing their
              areas. The metapopulation capacity should find many applications

  abstract = "Metapopulation theory teaches that the viability of
              metapopulations may be enlarged by decreasing the probability of
              extinction of local populations, or by increasing the
              colonization probability of empty habitat patches. In a
              metapopulation model study it has recently been found that
              reducing the extinction probability of the least extinction-prone
              patch and increasing the colonization probability between the two
              least extinction-prone patches are the best options to prolong
              the expected lifetime of a metapopulation. In this article I
              examine with a more detailed model whether this translates into
              enlarging the largest patch and reducing the interpatch distance
              between the largest patches. Using two measures of metapopulation
              persistence (longevity and resilience) I found, firstly, that the
              largest patch should generally be enlarged if the choice is to
              enlarge a patch by a certain percentage (relative change) and
              that the smallest patch should generally be enlarged if the
              choice is to enlarge a patch by a fixed amount of area (absolute
              change), and secondly that indeed one should reduce the
              interpatch distance between the two largest patches, if the
              choice is among all pairs of patches. The strength of these rules
              of thumb (particularly the second part of the first rule) depends
              on the parameter values, particularly the amount of clustering of
              patches, the mean dispersal distance and the number of
              dispersers. Also, the rules of thumb are less pronounced when

               typically either assumed spatial homogeneity for convenience or
               applied theoretically unjustified distance metrics to compensate
               for heterogeneity. Here I propose the isolation-by-resistance
               (IBR) model as an alternative for predicting equilibrium genetic
               structuring in complex landscapes. The model predicts a positive
               relationship between genetic differentiation and the resistance
               distance, a distance metric that exploits precise relationships
               between random walk times and effective resistances in
               electronic networks. As a predictor of genetic differentiation,
               the resistance distance is both more theoretically justified and
               more robust to spatial heterogeneity than Euclidean or least
               cost path-based distance measures. Moreover, the metric can be
               applied with a wide range of data inputs, including coarse-scale

              easier to measure experimentally. We use theoretical, simulation,
              and empirical approaches to bridge the gap between these
              different indices, and demonstrate that there is a proportional
              relationship between SR and LR, for metapopulations close to a

              showed genetic isolation, loss of allelic diversity and high
              relatedness, consistent with the collapse of fisheries in the

              well as those areas with potential to cause large-scale epidemics
              with ecosystem-wide impacts. * We find that the regions where
              COTS epidemics are known to originate are predictable from their
              high local and systemwide connectivity. Extensive larval
              exchanges among reef clusters in these regions can start a chain
              reaction of COTS population build-up. The same regions also have
              high potential to reach and affect other parts of the GBR,
              thereby maximizing the likelihood that any outbreaks would
              eventually propagate throughout the ecosystem. * Hydrodynamic
              properties and geography of the GBR make it vulnerable to COTS
              epidemics. Using network analysis to identify regions with
              high-risk high-impact sources could help control these
              devastating events in future. * Synthesis and applications. The
              observed centre of origin for COTS epidemics (the
              Cooktown--Cairns region) can be predicted from its elevated
              short- and long-range levels of larval connectivity. Connectivity
              analysis of per-reef risks provides spatially explicit targets to
              guide surveillance and control measures that might help curtail
              COTS epidemics through prioritization of highly connected reefs.
              The analytical approach developed here for COTS connectivity can
              also be applied to identify well-connected patches and regions in
              other interconnected ecological systems.",

               Ensuring that reserve populations are connected to each other
               and non-reserve populations by larval dispersal allows for
               recovery from disturbance and is a key aspect of resilience. In
               general, connectivity between reserves should increase as the
               distance between them decreases. However, enhancing connectivity
               may often tradeoff against a network's ability to
               representatively sample the system's natural variability. This
               ``representation'' objective is typically measured in terms of
               species richness or diversity of habitats, but has other
               important elements (e.g., minimizing the risk that multiple
               reserves will be impacted by catastrophic events). Such
               representation objectives tend to be better achieved as reserves
               become more widely spaced. Thus, optimizing the location, size
               and spacing of reserves requires both an understanding of larval
               dispersal and explicit consideration of how well the network
               represents the broader system; indeed the lack of an integrated
               theory for optimizing tradeoffs between connectivity and

               data on larval dispersal in corals and reef fishes, and on
               considerations for maintaining genetic diversity; (2) using a

               essential to inform land management decisions that include
               conservation and restoration goals. Indeed, to be able to
               develop a conservation plan that maintains animal movement
               through a fragmented landscape, spatial locations of habitat and
               paths among them need to be represented. Graph-based approaches
               have been proposed to determine paths among habitats at various
               scales and dispersal movement distances, and balance data
               requirements with information content. Conventional graphs,
               however, do not explicitly maintain geographic reference,
               reducing communication capacity and utility of other geo-spatial
               information. We present spatial graphs as a unifying theory for
               applying graph-based methods in a geographic context. Spatial
               graphs integrate a geometric reference system that ties patches
               and paths to specific spatial locations and spatial dimensions.
               Arguably, the complete graph, with paths between every pair of
               patches, may be one of the most relevant graphs from an
               ecosystem perspective, but it poses challenges to compute,
               process and visualize. We developed Minimum Planar Graphs as a
               spatial generalization of Delaunay triangulations to provide a

               particular the Minimum Planar Graph, to analyze woodland caribou

                 for each land cover based upon the facilitating or impeding
                 impact on species movement. Ideally resistance values would be
                 parameterised with empirical data, but due to a shortage of

               controlled the area and degree of fragmentation of each
               landcover in a factorial experiment for a total of 20
               combinations replicated 100 times. In each landscape we compared
               eight sets of relative landcover qualities (cost values of 1 for
               habitat, between 1.5 and 150 for hospitable matrix, and
               3--10,000 for inhospitable matrix). We found that the spatial

               relative cost values assigned to landcover types and that the
               degree of sensitivity depended on the spatial structure of the
               landscape. Highest sensitivity was found in landscapes with
               fragmented habitat and between 20 and 50\% hospitable matrix;
               sensitivity decreased as habitat fragmentation decreased and the
               amount of hospitable matrix increased. As a means of coping with

                 overlooked property of this potential connectivity is that it

                 features, such as mesoscale eddies and alongshore jets,

                 comparing simulations of nearshore metapopulation dynamics
                 when potential connectivity is constant through time (i.e.,
                 when it is deterministic) and when it varies in time (i.e.,

              design is to ensure the persistence of species with diverse life
              histories and functional traits. Considering how species differ
              in their propensity to move within and between MPAs is therefore
              a key consideration for multi-species MPA network design. Here,
              we propose a conceptual framework to incorporate ecological
              processes that affect movement at multiple life stages into the
              MPA network design process. We illustrate how our framework can
              be implemented using a set of hypothetical species that represent
              regional trait diversity in coastal British Columbia, Canada. We
              focused on two ecological processes: (1) dispersal during the
              larval phase and (2) daily home range movement during the adult
              phase. To identify functional connectivity patterns, we used a
              biophysical model to simulate larval dispersal, and then
              prioritized highly-connected patches using a reserve selection
              algorithm. To ensure that individual reserves were commensurate
              with home ranges, we also imposed reserve size constraints.
              Candidate areas for protection were identified based on
              multi-species connectivity patterns and home range size
              constraints. Collectively, this conceptual framework offers a
              flexible approach to multi-species, cross-life stage conservation
              planning, which can be further adapted to address complex life

  abstract = "Abstract Coral reefs are threatened by human activities both on
              the land and in the sea. However, standard approaches for
              prioritizing locations for marine and terrestrial reserves
              neglect to consider connections between ecosystems. We
              demonstrate an integrated approach for coral reef conservation
              with the objective of prioritizing marine reserves close to
              catchments with high forest cover in order to facilitate
              ecological processes that rely upon intact land--sea protected
              area connections and minimize negative impact of land-based
              runoff on coral reefs. Our aims are to (1) develop and apply
              simple models of connections between ecosystems that require
              little data and (2) incorporate different types of connectivity
              models into spatial conservation prioritization. We compared how,
              if at all, the locations and attributes (e.g., costs) of
              priorities differ from an approach that ignores connections. We
              analyzed spatial prioritization plans that allow for no
              connectivity, adjacent connectivity in the sea, symmetric and
              asymmetric land--sea connectivity, and the combination of
              adjacent connectivity in the sea and asymmetric land--sea
              connectivity. The overall reserve system costs were similar for
              all scenarios. We discovered that integrated planning delivered
              substantially different spatial priorities compared to the
              approach that ignored connections. Only 11--40\% of sites that
              were high priority for conservation were similar between
              scenarios with and without connectivity. Many coral reefs that
              were a high priority when we considered adjacent connectivity in
              the sea and ignored land--sea connectivity were assigned to low
              priorities when symmetric land--sea connectivity was included,
              and vice versa. Our approach can be applied to incorporate
              connections between ecosystems.",

  title     = "Addressing longitudinal connectivity in the systematic
               conservation planning of fresh waters",
  author    = "Hermoso, V and Linke, S and Prenda, J and Possingham, H P",
  abstract  = "1. Freshwater conservation has received less attention than its
               terrestrial or marine counterparts. Given the accelerated rate
               of change and intensive human use that freshwater ecosystems are
               submitted to, it is urgent to focus more attention on fresh
               waters. Existing conservation planning tools -- such as Marxan
               -- need to be modified to account for the special nature of
               these systems. Connectivity plays a key role in freshwater
               ecosystems. Threats are mediated along river corridors, and the
               condition of the entire catchment influences river biodiversity
               downstream. This needs to be considered in conservation
               planning. 2. The probabilities of occurrence of nine native
               freshwater fish species in a Mediterranean river basin, obtained
               from Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines- Generalized
               Linear Model (MARS-GLM) models, were used as features to develop
               spatial conservation priorities. The priorities accounted for
               complementarity and spatial design issues. 3. To deal with the
               connected nature of rivers, we modified Marxan’s boundary length
               penalty, avoiding the selection of isolated planning units and
               forcing the inclusion of closer upstream areas. We introduced
               ‘virtual boundaries’ between non-headwater stream segments and
               added distance-weighted penalties to the overall connectivity
               cost (CP) when stream segments upstream of the selected planning
               units are not selected. 4. This approach to prioritising
               connectivity is concordant with ecological theory, as it
               considers the natural and roughly exponential decay of upstream
               influences with distance. It accounts for the natural capacity
               of rivers to mitigate impacts when designing reserves. When
               connectivity was not emphasised, Marxan prioritised natural
               corridors for longitudinal movements. In contrast, whole
               sub-basins were prioritised when connectivity was emphasised.
               Changing the relative emphasis on connectivity substantially
               changed the spatial prioritisation; our conservation investment
               could move from one basin to another. 5. Our novel approach to
               dealing with directional connectivity enables managers of
               freshwater systems to set ecologically meaningful spatial
               conservation priorities.",

                 threatened populations, this procedure selects networks that

  abstract  = "Real patterns of ecological connectivity are seldom explicitly
               or systematically accounted for systematic conservation
               planning, in part because commonly used decision support systems
               can only capture simplistic notions of connectivity.
               Conventionally, the surrogates used to represent connectivity in
               conservation plans have assumed the connection between two sites
               to be symmetric in strength. In reality, ecological linkages
               between sites are rarely symmetric and often strongly
               asymmetric. Here, we develop a novel formulation that enabled us
               to incorporate asymmetric connectivity into the conservation
               decision support system Marxan. We illustrate this approach
               using hypothetical examples of a river catchment and a group of
               reefs, and then apply it to case studies in the Snowy River
               catchment and Great Barrier Reef, Australia. We show that
               incorporating asymmetric ecological connectivity in systematic
               reserve design leads to solutions that more effectively capture

                 considered the best way to predict and manage species

                 they are computationally intensive and require extensive
                 knowledge of species' biology and behavior, limiting their
                 application in many cases. An alternative to SEPMs is graph
                 theory, which has minimal data requirements and efficient
                 algorithms. Although only recently introduced to landscape
                 ecology, graph theory is well suited to ecological
                 applications concerned with connectivity or movement. This
                 paper compares the performance of graph theory to a SEPM in
                 selecting important habitat patches for Wood Thrush
                 (Hylocichla mustelina) conservation. We use both models to
                 identify habitat patches that act as population sources and
                 persistent patches and also use graph theory to identify
                 patches that act as stepping stones for dispersal.
                 Correlations of patch rankings were very high between the two
                 models. In addition, graph theory offers the ability to
                 identify patches that are very important to habitat
                 connectivity and thus long-term population persistence across
                 the landscape. We show that graph theory makes very similar
                 predictions in most cases and in other cases offers insight
                 not available from the SEPM, and we conclude that graph theory
                 is a suitable and possibly preferable alternative to SEPMs for
