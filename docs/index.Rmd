Marxan Connect (henceforth the "app") is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to help conservationists include "connectivity" in their protected area network planning.

The term "connectivity" has a variety of definitions (i.e. larval connectivity, genetic connectivity, landscape connectivity, etc) and protected area networks can be optimized for various connectivity objectives. The app is intended to guide conservationists through the process of identifying important aspects of connectivity for their conservation scenarios as well as highlighting the necessary data.

The app also includes a fully functional Python module that is operated via command line. The Python module, [`marxanconpy`](https://github.com/remi-daigle/MarxanConnect/blob/master/marxanconpy.py), can be used to reproduce an analysis using the project file (`.MarCon`) generated by the GUI (in progress).

To use this software, please visit the [Tutorial](https://remi-daigle.github.io/MarxanConnect/tutorial) and the [Glossary](https://remi-daigle.github.io/MarxanConnect/glossary) (both in progress). Otherwise, if you would just like to get started, please [install](#installing) the app and proceed through all the tabs from left to right starting the "Spatial Input". After calculating the "Connectivity Metrics", you can choose to conduct a Marxan analysis in the app, export the connectivity metrics for use in a standalone custom Marxan analysis, or you can visualize the Connectivity Metrics using the "Plotting Options" tab

If you would like to report any bugs or request a missing feature, please post an issue on the GitHub repository or [email](mailto:remi.daigle@dal.ca?subject=Marxan%20with%20Connectivity%20bug%20or%20feature%20request) (although GitHub is preferred). Please provide as much information as possible, such as: detailed description, app version, operating system, even a link to your data if relevant (also, see [Contributing](https://remi-daigle.github.io/MarxanConnect/#contributing)).

# Installing

## Windows Installer

(**WARNING! Marxan Connect is in 'beta' release and is not yet fully tested.**)

Please download the latest [MarxanConnect-vX-Y-Z-windows-setup.exe](https://github.com/remi-daigle/MarxanConnect/releases) installer file, run it, and follow the instructions. Alternatively (for advanced users only), follow the [Building from source](https://remi-daigle.github.io/MarxanConnect/#building-from-source) instructions to use the latest bleeding edge version of the app.

## Windows Zipped Bundle

If you cannot use the installer because you do not have administrative privileges, we've provided a zipped bundle of the app to allow users to bypass that problem. To use, download the latest [MarxanConnect.zip](https://github.com/remi-daigle/MarxanConnect/releases), unzip it to your preferred destination (e.g. `~/Desktop`), and double-click `MarxanConnectGUI.exe`. In this case you will have to generate any start menu shortcuts, or file associations (i.e. `.MarCon`) manually.

# Building from source

Not for the typical user. Building from source is only necessary if you plan to contribute to the project (see [Contributing](https://remi-daigle.github.io/MarxanConnect/#contributing) section below) or if you want to use the bleeding edge version of the app.

Building this repository has only been tested on Python 3.5.2 64-bit on a machine running Windows 10, your mileage may vary! (*Please note, I could not build the app using Anaconda*). 

* Download this repository
* If necessary, edit the hard coded file paths in [setup.py](https://github.com/remi-daigle/MarxanConnect/blob/master/setup.py) and [WindowsSetupBuilder.iss](https://github.com/remi-daigle/MarxanConnect/blob/master/WindowsSetupBuilder.iss)
* open a terminal or `cmd` window (or git bash) in the project directory and type:

```
make
```

## Prerequisites (for building from source)

* [Python 3.5.2 64-bit](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/)
* [wxFormBuilder](https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder)
* [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
* [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and the [`rmarkdown`](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) package

It also assumes you have all the pre-requisite python modules installed, i.e.:

```
#!/bin/bash
# for basic GUI
pip install wxpython
pip install matplotlib
pip install matplotlib.basemap
pip install geopandas
pip install descartes
pip install python-igraph
pip install shapely
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install bs4


# for compiling executable
pip install cx_Freeze
```

# Built With

The `gui.py` file was built using the fantastic [wxFormBuilder](https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder).

The windows installer was built using [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).

THe documentation and website was built with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and the [`rmarkdown`](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) package
