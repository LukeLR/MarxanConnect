**NEW**  Marxan Connect is a semi-finalist for the Conservation X tech prize! Check out the [latest developments](https://conservationx.com/project/id/157/marxanconnect) and the Marxan Connect [bioRxiv preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/07/315424) is now available!

Marxan Connect (henceforth the "app") is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to help conservationists include "connectivity" in their protected area network planning.

The term "connectivity" has a variety of definitions (i.e. larval connectivity, genetic connectivity, landscape connectivity, etc) and protected area networks can be optimized for various connectivity objectives. The app is intended to guide conservationists through the process of identifying important aspects of connectivity for their conservation scenarios as well as highlighting the necessary data.

The app also includes a fully functional Python package that is operated via command line. The Python package, [`marxanconpy`](https://remi-daigle.github.io/marxanconpy/), can be used to reproduce an analysis using the project file (`.MarCon`) generated by the GUI.

To use this software, please visit the [Tutorial](./tutorial.html) and the [Glossary](./glossary.html) (both in progress). Otherwise, if you would just like to get started, please [install](#installing) the app and proceed through all the tabs from left to right starting the "Spatial Input". After calculating the "Connectivity Metrics", you can choose to conduct a Marxan or Marxan with Zones analysis in the app, export the connectivity metrics for use in a standalone custom Marxan analysis, or you can visualize the Connectivity Metrics using the "Plotting Options" tab

If you would like to report any bugs or request a missing feature, please post an issue on the GitHub repository or [email](mailto:remi.daigle@dal.ca?subject=Marxan%20with%20Connectivity%20bug%20or%20feature%20request) (although GitHub is preferred). Please provide as much information as possible, such as: detailed description, app version, operating system, even a link to your data if relevant (also, see [Contributing](#contributing)). 

In terms of using the software for conservation planning, 'best practices' (*i.e. detailed documentation, case studies) are currently under development.

# Installing Marxan Connect

Marxan Connect was built for Windows 10. Users may find compatibility issues with Windows 7 or 8 (the app may not be able to run Marxan, but can create Marxan files to run manually). The app is currently not compatible with Linux and Mac although the python processing script ([`marxanconpy`](https://github.com/remi-daigle/MarxanConnect/blob/master/marxanconpy.py)) and GUI scripts ([`gui`](https://github.com/remi-daigle/MarxanConnect/blob/master/gui.py) and [`MarxanConnectGUI`](https://github.com/remi-daigle/MarxanConnect/blob/master/MarxanConnectGUI.py)) were designed with interoperability in mind. 

## Windows Installer

(**WARNING! Marxan Connect is in 'beta' release**)

Please download the latest [MarxanConnect-vX-Y-Z-windows-setup.exe](https://github.com/remi-daigle/MarxanConnect/releases) installer file, run it, and follow the instructions. Alternatively (for advanced users only), follow the [Building from source](#building-from-source) instructions to use the latest bleeding edge version of the app.

## Windows Zipped Bundle

If you cannot use the installer because you do not have administrative privileges, we've provided a zipped bundle of the app to allow users to bypass that problem. To use, download the latest [MarxanConnect.zip](https://github.com/remi-daigle/MarxanConnect/releases), unzip it to your preferred destination (e.g. `~/Desktop`), and double-click `MarxanConnectGUI.exe`. In this case you will have to generate any start menu shortcuts, or file associations (i.e. `.MarCon`) manually.

# Installing marxanconpy

For users who prefer the command line, please visit the [`marxanconpy` website](https://remi-daigle.github.io/marxanconpy/)

# Building from source

Not for the typical user. Building from source is only necessary if you plan to contribute to the project (see [Contributing](#contributing) section below) or if you want to use the bleeding edge version of the app.

* Download this repository
* If necessary, edit the hard coded file paths in [setup.py](https://github.com/remi-daigle/MarxanConnect/blob/master/setup.py) and [WindowsSetupBuilder.iss](https://github.com/remi-daigle/MarxanConnect/blob/master/WindowsSetupBuilder.iss)
* open a terminal or `cmd` window (or git bash) in the project directory and type:

```
make
```

Alternatively, you can compile the website with `make web`, the Marxan Connect executable with `make exe`, the windows installer `make win`, and the zip with `make zip`

## Prerequisites (for building from source)

* [Python 3 64-bit](https://www.python.org/downloads) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
* [wxFormBuilder](https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder)
* [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
* [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and the [`rmarkdown`](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) package
* [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) and pandoc-citeproc

It also assumes you have all the pre-requisite python modules installed to build the app itself, *i.e.*:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#!/bin/bash
# for basic GUI
pip install marxanconpy
pip install wxpython
pip install matplotlib
# matplotlib.basemap see https://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/installing.html
pip install geopandas
pip install descartes
pip install python-igraph
pip install shapely
pip install pandas
pip install numpy

# for compiling executable
pip install cx_Freeze
```

As well as pre-requesite R packages to build the website, *i.e.*:

```{r install R packages}
if(!require("sf")) install.packages("sf")
if(!require("leaflet")) install.packages("leaflet")
if(!require("tmap")) install.packages("tmap")
if(!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
if(!require("DT")) install.packages("DT")
if(!require("igraph")) install.packages("igraph")
if(!require("ggraph")) install.packages("ggraph")
if(!require("gganimate")) devtools::install_github('thomasp85/gganimate')
if(!require("tidygraph")) install.packages("tidygraph")
if(!require("RColorBrewer")) install.packages("RColorBrewer")
```

# Built With

The `gui.py` file was built using the fantastic [wxFormBuilder](https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder).

The windows installer was built using [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).

THe documentation and website was built with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and the [`rmarkdown`](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) package
