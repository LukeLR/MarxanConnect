# Overview

The following section provides an example of a possible workflow using **demographic** connectivity data as a **conservation feature** in Marxan. It is important to note that these are indeed examples of the software's capabilities and are not intended to be used as scientific advice in a spatial conservation planning process.

The maps and plots shown in this tutorial were created in R using the shapefile exported from the "Plotting Options" tab of Marxan Connect. The R code used to make the plots can be revealed by clicking on the `Code` button below

```{r load packages,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sf)

library(leaflet)

library(tmap)

library(tidyverse)

library(DT)

# set default projection for leaflet

proj <- "+proj=merc +a=6378137 +b=6378137 +lat_ts=0.0 +lon_0=0.0 +x_0=0.0 +y_0=0 +k=1.0 +units=m +nadgrids=@null +wktext  +no_defs"

```
# Case Study

In this case study, we will be working with data from the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. 
Our represenation features consist of a subset of [bioregions](http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/17301/reef-bioregions-in-the-gbrmp-and-gbrwh.pdf) identified by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the connectivity input data consists of calculated probabilities from the spatial distribution of reefs and estimated biological parameters.

# Input Data

Download the example [project folder](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/remi-daigle/MarxanConnect/tree/master/docs/tutorial/CF_demographic). This folder contains the Marxan Connect Project file, input data, and output data for this example.

Before opening Marxan Connect, let's manually look through the Marxan database to view the standard set of input files (**spec.dat**, **puvspr.dat**, **bound.dat**, and **pu.dat**) in the **input** folder of the **CF_demographic** folder. 

The planning unit file (**hex_planning_units.shp**) includes 653 hexagonal planning units that cover the Great Barrier Reef. 


## `spec.dat`

```{r}

spec <- read.csv("tutorial/CF_demographic/input/spec.dat")

datatable(spec,rownames = FALSE, options = list(searching = FALSE))

```

## `puvspr.dat`
The table shown here is a trimmed version showing the first 30 rows as an example of the type of data in the puvspr.dat file. The original dataset has 974 entries.

```{r}

puvspr <- read.csv("tutorial/CF_demographic/input/puvspr.dat")

datatable(puvspr[1:30,],rownames = FALSE, options = list(searching = FALSE))

```
## `bound.dat`
The table shown here is a trimmed version showing the first 30 rows as an example of the type of data in the bound.dat file. The original dataset has 3600 entries.

```{r}
bound <- read.csv("tutorial/CF_demographic/input/bound.dat")

datatable(bound[1:30,],rownames = FALSE, options = list(searching = FALSE))
```

## `pu.dat`

The table shown here is a trimmed version showing the first 30 rows as an example of the type of data in the pu.dat file. The original dataset has 653 entries.

```{r}
pu <- read.csv("tutorial/CF_demographic/input/pu.dat")

datatable(pu[1:30,],rownames = FALSE, options = list(searching = FALSE))
```

## Conservation Features

This map shows the bioregions, which serve as conservation features in the Marxan analysis with no connectivity. 

```{r}

puvspr_wide <- puvspr %>%
    
    left_join(select(spec,"id","name"),
              
              by=c("species"="id")) %>%
    
    select(-species) %>%
    
    spread(key="name",value="amount")

# planning units with output

output <- read.csv("tutorial/CF_demographic/output/pu_no_connect.csv") %>%
    
    mutate(geometry=st_as_sfc(geometry,"+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"),
           
           best_solution = as.logical(best_solution)) %>%
    
    st_as_sf() %>%
    
    left_join(puvspr_wide,by=c("FID"="pu"))

```

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

map <- leaflet(output) %>%
    
    addTiles()

groups <- names(select(output,-best_solution,-select_freq))[c(-1,-2)]

groups <- groups[groups!="geometry"]

for(i in groups){
    
    z <- unlist(data.frame(output)[i])
    
    if(is.numeric(z)){
        
        pal <- colorBin("YlOrRd", domain = z)
        
    }else{
        
        pal <- colorFactor("YlOrRd", domain = z)
        
    }
    
    map = map %>%
        
        addPolygons(fillColor = ~pal(z),
                    
                    fillOpacity = 0.6,
                    
                    weight=0.5,
                    
                    color="white",
                    
                    group=i,
                    
                    label = as.character(z)) %>%
        
        addLegend(pal = pal,
                  
                  values = z,
                  
                  title = i,
                  
                  group = i,
                  
                  position="bottomleft")
    
}

map <- map %>%
    
    addLayersControl(overlayGroups  = groups,
                     
                     options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE))

for(i in groups){
    
    map <- map %>% hideGroup(i)
    
}

map %>%
    
    showGroup("BIORE_102")

```

## Connectivity data

The connectivity data is at the 'heart' of Marxan Connect's functionality. It allows the generation of new conservation features and/or spatial dependencies to be characterized and included based on connectivity metrics. Let's examine the spatial layers we've added in order to incorporate connectivity into this Marxan analysis. Marxan Connect needs a shapefile for the [planning units](glossary.html#5_planning_units), and **optionally** [focus areas](glossary.html#4_focus_areas) and [avoidance areas](glossary.html#4_focus_areas). For simplicity, we have not included focus or avoidance areas in this tutorial. These spatial layers are shown in the map below.

```{r load all layers for CF_demographic,results='hide'}

# planning units

pu <- st_read("tutorial/CF_demographic/hex_planning_units.shp") %>%
    
    st_transform(proj)

```

```{r}
p <- qtm(pu,fill = '#7570b3')

tmap_leaflet(p) %>%
    
    addLegend(position = "topright",
              
              labels = c("Planning Units"),
              
              colors = c("#7570b3"),
              
              title = "Layers")

```

## `hexflow.csv`

The connectivity data for this analysis can be found in the **hexFlow.csv** file in the **CF_demographic** folder. For this example, we have created the connectivity matrix for you. We note, however, that for demographic connectivity analyses, this file should be created in the Marxan Connect workflow and should best reflect the demographic connectivity goals of the user. For landscape connectivity data, Marxan Connect does have some functionality to create connectivity matrices from resistance data (see [landscape connectivity tutorial] (./CSD_landscape.html)). 

For the sake of your web browser, this table only contains the 7 rows and columns of the connectivity matrix. The real file is a 653 X 653 matrix.

```{r}

conmat <- read.csv("tutorial/CF_demographic/hexFlow.csv",check.names = FALSE)[1:7,1:7]

datatable(conmat,rownames = FALSE, options = list(searching = FALSE))

```

# Marxan Connect

## Loading your project in Marxan Connect

Now that we have explored the input files, we are ready to open Marxan Connect and load our project. Please load the `tutorial.MarCon` file in the **CF_demographic** folder into Marxan Connect. You should not have to change any inputs in the project, but it is important to understand what these choices entail. 

![**Figure 1:** *Loading Marxan Connect tutorial .*\label{workflow}](images/Load_tutorial.png)

We will now step through the Marxan Connect workflow following the work flow tabs.

![**Figure 2:** *Workflow tabs .*\label{workflow}](images/workflow_tabs.png)

## Spatial Input

After loading `tutorial.MarCon` your **Spatial Input** tab should now look something like this:

![**Figure 3:** *Spatial Input tab .*\label{workflow}](images/Spatial_Input_tab_demographic.png)

Make sure that the **Planning Unit Shapefile** and when relevant, the, **Focus Area Shapefile** and **Avoidance Area Shapefile** correspond to the appropriate input files (the Focus and Avoidance areas are not used in this example). On this tab, you can also choose whether the **Focus Area Shapefile** and **Avoidance Areas Shapefile** should be locked in, locked out, or status-quo (i.e. the planning unit status stays the same as what is designated in the pu.dat file). 

Now we are ready to proceed to the **Connectivity Input** tab.

## Connectivity Input

Since we are working with demographic data, we choose the **Demographic Input** option from the **Choose Connectivity Input Category** dropdown menu. Alternatively, **Landscape Input** could be chosen (see [landscape connectivity tutorial] (./CSD_landscape.html)). 

On this tab, ensure that the **Connectivity Matrix** refers to the correct file. For this example, this should read **hexFlow.csv**. Since this data represents the _amount_ of movement between planning units (*i.e.* number of larvae) in a matrix format (*i.e.* a [flow](glossary.html#flow) matrix), we have selected the **Flow** Connectivity Matrix Type and the **Matrix** Format. 

Additionally, we have chosen the **Identical Grids** option from the **Rescale Connectivity Matrix** menu. This signifies that our connectivity data is on an identical grid as our planning units. If our connectivity data was not on the same grid as our planning units, we could choose to rescale the connectivity matrix, which essentially does a spatial averaging routine to calculate connectivity on the planning unit grid. If rescaling is chosen, the user needs to decide whether to rescale the connectivity data proportional to the overlap or to assume homogeneous connectivity. For example, if a planning unit has a 50% overlap with connectivity data (i.e. half of the planning unit has connectivity data, and the other half does not), and the connectivity value is 10, does the user want the connectivity value to be taken from a spatial average across that planning unit (i.e. the connectivity value of that planning unit would then be 5) or be considered homogenous across the planning unit (i.e. a connectivity value of 10).

Your **Connectivity Input** tab should look like this (you should not have to change any settings):

![**Figure 4:** *Connectivity Input Tab .*\label{workflow}](images/Connectivity_Input_tab_demographic.png)

Now proceed to the **Connectivity Metrics** tab.

## Connectivity Metrics

In this example, we have chosen to use the **google page rank metric** to create our connectivity-based conservation feature. However, there are a variety of metrics to choose from. We encourage you to scroll through the drop down menu in the top right corner for definitions, possible objectives and the mathematical formulations for different connectivity-based conservation feature options. We will ignore the **Planning Unit Dependency as Boundary Definition** in this example. 

![**Figure 5:** *Connectivity Metrics Tab .*\label{workflow}](images/Connectivity_Metrics_tab_demographic.png)

Once you have selected a demographic conservation feature press **Calculate Metrics**. A pop-up window should appear stating that the metric has been calculated successfully. Next, proceed to the **Pre-Evaluation** tab.

## Pre-Evaluation

This page allows you to evaluate the metrics created in the **Connectivity Metrics** tab in more detail. It also allows you to choose how you would like to transform the continuous connectivity metrics into conservation features for further analysis. To discretize the continuous metric, we've used the **Quartile** option and set the *median* of the continuous metric Google PageRank as the lower threshold (**Make discrete feature from**) and the *maximum* value as the upper threshold (**Make discrete feature to:**). Once you have established the parameters of your desired metric, press **Create New Feature**. 

When this is complete, your new discrete feature should appear under  **Continuous Metric Available for Export**.

![**Figure 6:** *Pre-Evaluation tab .*\label{workflow}](images/Pre_Eval_tab_demographic.png)

Now we are ready to move to the **Marxan Files** tab.

## Marxan Files 

Here, we add our new connectivity metric features to our Marxan input files. In this example, we've chosen to append the new connectivity based conservation features to the existing Marxan files by selecting **Append**  under the **Metrics** option box. Ensure your original **puvspr.dat** and **spec.dat** files are listed by the **Original .. Feature File** options. You can then name the new, appended files in the **New ... Conservation Feature File** tabs.  If you choose the same filename for the new files as the original files, the original files will be overwritten. 

In this tab, you will also set a target for each connectivity based conservation feature. This can be done by setting a proportion (e.g. 10% of the entire feature) or a target (e.g. number of total whales - if your puvspr file contains amounts). However, for a connectivity feature this will be the number of planning units that contain the discrete feature.

Once the files are named, press **Export Both Conservation Features Files**. A pop-up window should appear stating that the export was successful. You should now see two new appended files in your Marxan database **input** folder.  

Let's examine the appended files that were created. Locate the **spec_connect.dat** and **puvspr_connect.dat** files (or whatever filenames you have chosen) in your Marxan directory. They should resemble the tables in the following two sections.

### `spec_connect.dat`

Selecting the third page of the appended spec_connect.dat file, you will find an additional row (21 in this example) with the target for this new connectivity based conservation feature.

```{r}

spec <- read.csv("tutorial/CF_demographic/input/spec_connect.dat")

datatable(spec,rownames = FALSE, options = list(searching = FALSE))

```

### `puvspr_connect.dat`

The table shown here is a trimmed version showing the first 30 rows as an example of the type of data in the puvspr_connect.dat file. The original dataset has 1627 entries.

Selecting the third page of the appended file, you will find additional rows (corresponding to our new conservation feature, which is 'species 21' in this example) with the amount of this feature in each planning unit (For our connectivity based features, this will always be 1).

```{r}

puvspr <- read.csv("tutorial/CF_demographic/input/puvspr_connect.dat")

datatable(puvspr[1:30,],rownames = FALSE, options = list(searching = FALSE))

```

Now that the necessary connectivity files have been created, We are ready to run Marxan Connect. Proceed to the **Run Marxan** tab.

## Run Marxan 

On this tab, we will run Marxan via Marxan Connect. 

Make sure that the **Marxan Input File** corresponds to the new **input_connect.dat** file. In this example, we have created the **input_connect.dat** file for you. However, when using your own data, you will need to create this file yourself (manually or with the 'customize' button that calls Marxan's 'inedit'), following the same format as the file that is provided.  Please see the traditional [Marxan documentation](http://marxan.net/userguides) for more information
![**Figure 7:** *Marxan Analysis tab .*\label{workflow}](images/Marxan_analysis_tab_demographic.png)

To run Marxan, press the **Run Marxan** button in the bottom right corner of this tab. 

Running Marxan with the connectivity conservation features results in the following Marxan solution:

```{r}

# planning units with output

output <- read.csv("tutorial/CF_demographic/output/pu_connect.csv") %>%
    
    mutate(geometry=st_as_sfc(geometry,"+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"),
           
           best_solution = as.logical(best_solution)) %>%
    
    st_as_sf()

```

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

map <- leaflet(output) %>%
    
    addTiles()

groups <- c("best_solution","select_freq")

for(i in groups){
    
    z <- unlist(data.frame(output)[i])
    
    if(is.numeric(z)){
        
        pal <- colorBin("YlOrRd", domain = z)
        
    }else{
        
        pal <- colorFactor("YlOrRd", domain = z)
        
    }
    
    map = map %>%
        
        addPolygons(fillColor = ~pal(z),
                    
                    fillOpacity = 0.6,
                    
                    weight=0.5,
                    
                    color="white",
                    
                    group=i,
                    
                    label = as.character(z)) %>%
        
        addLegend(pal = pal,
                  
                  values = z,
                  
                  title = i,
                  
                  group = i,
                  
                  position="bottomleft")
    
}

map <- map %>%
    
    addLayersControl(overlayGroups  = groups,
                     
                     options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE))

for(i in groups){
    
    map <- map %>% hideGroup(i)
    
}

map %>%
    
    showGroup("select_freq")

```

Here is the output of our example with no connectivity for comparison. 

```{r}

# planning units with output

    mutate(geometry=st_as_sfc(geometry,"+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"),
           
           best_solution = as.logical(best_solution)) %>%
    
    st_as_sf()

```

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

    if(is.numeric(z)){
        
        pal <- colorBin("YlOrRd", domain = z)
        
    }else{

    }
    
    map = map %>%

                    group=i,
                    
                    label = as.character(z)) %>%
        
        addLegend(pal = pal,
                  
                  values = z,

for(i in groups){
    
    map <- map %>% hideGroup(i)
    
}

map %>%
    
    showGroup("select_freq")

```

## Plotting Options

Here the users can plot up to two layers of input or output data on a built-in basemap (provided by the [basemap](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/) package). The tab allows users to choose a few basic color, transparency, and legend positioning options, as well as export the output data in various formats to provide further plotting or analysis options.
