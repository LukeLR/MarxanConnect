# Introduction to Marxan Connect

Because we recognize that there is considerable investment in Marxan-based prioritization, Marxan Connect was designed to help conservation practitioners incorporate connectivity into existing Marxan analyses. It acts as a preprocessing module to prepare connectivity data for inclusion in a Marxan analysis (Figure 1).

![**Figure 1:** *Comparison of workflows between Marxan and "Marxan Connect." Marxan Connect facilitates the use of connectivity data, derived from tagging data, genetics, dispersal models, resistance models, or geographic distance, by producing connectivity metrics and connectivity strengths (i.e. spatial dependencies) to be used as boundary definitions before running Marxan. These connectivity metrics and linkage strengths are then used as input (conservation features and/or boundary definitions) in the traditional Marxan workflow. The cost data in the traditional Marxan analysis refers to the cost of protecting a planning unit (i.e. opportunity cost), not the cost to traverse a landscape.*\label{workflow}](images/workflow.png)

Marxan Connect allows users to export data products (*e.g.* connectivity metrics, marxan files, etc) at any of the above steps to enable users to base their workflow in or outside Marxan Connect.

The workflow is divided into seprate tabs at represent steps in the analysis.

![**Figure 2:** *Tabs within Marxan Connect that represent steps in the workflow.*\label{workflow}](images/Fig2_workflow_tabs.png)

## Spatial Input

This tab allows users to identify and load their [planning units](./glossary.html#planning_units), and optionally [focus areas](./glossary.html#focus_areas) or [avoidance areas](./glossary.html#avoidance_areas).

## Connectivity Input

This tab allows users to input their demographic or landscape-based connectivity data. It also allows users to generate some landscape-based data or rescale demographic-based data. However, rescaling connectivity data can be problematic and it is preferable to collect or generate the connectivity data to the scale of the [planning units](./glossary.html#planning_units).

For the landscape connectivity approach, Marxan Connect calculates connectivity metrics from networks based either on Euclidean distance or least-cost path between the centroid of planning units. However, other software packages such as [Circuitscape](http://www.circuitscape.org/) [@McRae2009-aq] and [Conefor](http://www.conefor.org/) [@Saura2009-sa] currently provide a richer set of options and specialized  methods. These software packages can be used to generate custom conservation features or connectivity matrices both of which can then be used in Marxan Connect. For example, one could generate a network using current density using Circuitscape and input the resulting connectivity matrix into Marxan Connect to generate conservation features or spatial dependencies.

## Connectivity Metrics

This tab guides users in their choice of methods and metrics, and allows them to calculate those metrics.

## Pre-Evaluation

This tab allows users to modify (*i.e.* discretize) connectivity metrics and export Marxan formatted files.

## Marxan Analysis

This tab allows users to operate Marxan from Marxan Connect.

## Plotting Options

This tab allows users to plot connectivity metrics and Marxan results. It also allows the users to export maps and shapefiles that contain those connectivity metrics and Marxan results.

# Integrating connectivity data into spatial prioritization

## Using connectivity data as a 'feature'

A simple and accessible way to integrate connectivity data into spatial prioritization is to treat it as a conservation feature [@DAloia2017-jp; @Magris2018-yb; @White2014-sk]. These connectivity-based conservation features are obtained by calculating connectivity metric(s) which represent connectivity process(es)  (*e.g.* Betweenness centrality), and then choosing a threshold value(s) from the range of this metric, ideally after ecological assessment or sensitivity analysis. The planning units that meet the threshold(s) are then discretized into unique features (*i.e.* priority areas) for which a target ${T_j}$ is set (Figure 3). In the classical minimum set problem (*i.e.* Marxan), a target is set for each feature, ${T_j}$, (*e.g.* 50% of feature ${j}$) and the reserve system needs to contain at least that amount. The amount of connectivity-based conservation feature ${j}$ in planning unit ${i}$ (*i.e.* ${r_{ij}}$) is binary and is determined by whether the connectivity metric is above the threshold. Similarly, this type of threshold setting is often used with species distribution models, where each planning unit is assigned a probability of species occurrence, and a threshold value is used to convert these continuous distribution data to a binary map (presence vs absence or suitable vs unsuitable) used for a particular species (*e.g.*, @Minor2008-js). When appropriate, discrete and very high priority planning units could alternatively be "locked-in" to the final solution to guarantee their inclusion. Definitions and potential conservation objectives for each connectivity based conservation feature available in Marxan Connect can be found on in the [glossary](./glossary.html).

In the absence of ecologically pre-determined thresholds, an appropriate value for the thresholds and ${T_j}$ can be determined by using a cost trade-off curve, similar to calibrating the Boundary Length Modifier (BLM), where one would test the sensitivity of cost of the best solution and the total summed metric. It is worth noting that the BLM may interact with the thresholds and ${T_j}$. The value of the thresholds and ${T_j}$ could be chosen as the divergent point, where the greatest increase in the connectivity metric is achieved for a relatively small increase in cost. However, the preferred approach would be to establish conservation targets which lead to a reserve network design which meets ecologically relevant conservation objective(s) such as population viability or a within network metapopulation growth rate > 1 (See "Post-hoc evaluation" section for more details).

![**Figure 3:** *Data processing workflow for three possible workflows for using raw connectivity data in spatial prioritization: 1) Connectivity as Spatial Dependency in the objective function (Raw Data -> Connectivity Matrix -> Connectivity as Spatial Dependency), or 2) Discrete conservation features (Raw Data -> Connectivity Matrix -> Continuous Metrics -> Threshold Setting -> Discretize Feature -> Target Setting. Red arrows indicate the conservation feature vs connectivity strength method decision point.* \label{general_workflow}](images/general_workflow_new.png)

## Connectivity as spatial dependencies in the objective function

Another approach to incorporate connectivity in Marxan is using the directional connectivity-based data to inform the boundary cost ${cv_{ih}}$. This cost signifies the penalty associated with protecting one site but not its well-connected partner site [@Beger2010-ir]. Here, a directional connectivity data is used to parameterize the boundary cost between all pairs of planning units and set the importance of incorporating connectivity with the Boundary Length Modifier (BLM), also called  "Connectivity Strength Modifier" (CSM) [@Beger2010-ir]. Increasing the BLM reduces the edge to area ratio by minimizing costs associated with unprotected boundaries; similarly, increasing the CSM will reduce the "leakiness" of the network (i.e. amount lost from the network) by minimizing costs associated with unprotected connectivity linkages, and thus maximising connectivity strengths across the entire Marxan solution.

The approach of using connectivity estimates as spatial dependencies in the objective function has been used to design MPAs in the Coral Triangle [@Beger2010-ir; @Beger2015-zo]. This approach can maximize the within-network connectivity, and may improve the metapopulation growth rate and other performance metrics. In Marxan Connect, one can combine the use of connectivity as spatial dependencies with a locked-in "Focus Area" (*e.g.* an existing protected area) to generate candidate stepping stones. However, it should be noted that the method will likely triage isolated sites out of the final solution unless these are included using other methods (*e.g.* a conservation feature for an isolated site which happens to contain a unique species).

# Project Files

Marxan Connect allows users to save Marxan Connect Project files (.MarCon) which is a JSON formatted text file that stores all the filepaths, options, and connectivity metrics defined by the user. This not only allows users to start off from their last save point, but it also allows project portability and reproducibility. It is recommended to keep Marxan Connect Project files in the root directory of your project folder (i.e. the folder that contains all the Marxan inputs, outputs, etc) since all filepaths outside this folder will be recorded as absolute paths and then the Marxan Connect Project file will not work on another computer.

# `marxanconpy` Python Module

This python module, [`marxanconpy`](https://remi-daigle.github.io/marxanconpy/), contains the mathematical heart of Marxan Connect and can be used independently via the command line.
