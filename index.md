# Marxan with Connectivity

Marxan with Connectivity (henceforth the "app") is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to help conservationists include "connectivity" in their protected area network planning.

The term "connectivity" has a variety of definitions (i.e. larval connectivity, genetic connectivity, landscape connectivity, etc) and protected area networks can be optimized for various connectivity objectives. The app is intended to guide conservationists through the process of identifying important aspects of connectivity for their conservation scenarios as well as highlighting the necessary data.

The app also includes be a fully functional python module (in progress) that is operated via command line that can be used to reproduce an analysis using the project file generated by the GUI.

## Installing

### Windows Installer:

(**WARNING! Marxan with Connectivity is 'pre-alpha' and is not yet fully operational, download at your own risk**)

Please download the latest [MarxanConnectSetupWindows.exe](https://github.com/remi-daigle/MarxanConnect/releases) installer file, run it, and follow the instructions. Alternatively (for advanced users only), follow the [Building from source](https://github.com/remi-daigle/MarxanConnect#building-from-source) instructions to use the latest bleeding edge version of the app.

### Mac and Linux Installers:
(in progress)

## Building from source

Building from source is only necessary if you plan to contribute to the project (see [Contributing](https://github.com/remi-daigle/MarxanConnect/blob/master/README.md#Contributing) section below) or if you want to use the bleeding edge version of the app

Building this repository has only been tested on Python 3.5.2 64-bit on a machine running Windows 10, your mileage may vary! (*Please note, I could not build the repository using Anaconda*). 

* Download this repository
* If necessary, edit the hard coded file paths in [setup.py](https://github.com/remi-daigle/MarxanConnect/blob/master/setup.py) and [Marxan with Connectivity.nsi](https://github.com/remi-daigle/MarxanConnect/blob/master/Marxan%20with%20Connectivity.nsi)
* open a terminal or `cmd` window (or git bash) in the project directory and type:

```
make
```

### Prerequisites (for building from source)

* [Python 3.5.2 64-bit](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/)
* [wxFormBuilder](https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder)
* [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page)
* [NSIS Quick Setup Script Generator](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NSIS_Quick_Setup_Script_Generator)

It also assumes you have all the pre-requisite python modules installed, i.e.:

```
#!/bin/bash
# for basic GUI
pip install wxpython
pip install matplotlib
pip install matplotlib.basemap
pip install geopandas
pip install descartes
pip install python-igraph
pip install networkx

# for compiling executable
pip install cx_Freeze
pip install sys
pip install os
```

## Built With

The `gui.py` file was built using the fantastic [wxFormBuilder](https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder).

The windows installer was built using [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page) and the [NSIS Quick Setup Script Generator](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NSIS_Quick_Setup_Script_Generator)
